Mouthwatering menus and outstanding hospitality keep your customers coming back to your restaurant, but how do you get them through the door?¬†Great restaurant logos are the secret ingredient. 
---flag---
The best restaurant logos ensure that you stand out among the already-crowded culinary competition. It‚Äôs what catches a second glance from potential customers, sets a mood and can even stir up discussions on social media and foodie blogs. These are all super effective ways that design can make your restaurant (or your pub, cafe, or food truck) even more successful.¬†
---flag---
Whether you create culinary delicacies or serve up pub grub and beer, having a great restaurant logo is important because you want to be remembered. In this piece, we‚Äôll run you through a variety of delectable restaurant logo ideas that are sure to inspire you and tickle your taste buds.
---flag---
There‚Äôs a lot to consider as you start dreaming up your restaurant logo design: cuisine, location, style, personality and, perhaps most important, your customers.¬†
---flag---
Louise Fili, an award-winning Italian-American graphic designer who specializes in brand development for food packaging and restaurants, says the importance of thinking through all these questions beforehand is all ‚Äúabout knowing what you don‚Äôt know.‚Äù Wherever you‚Äôre at with your brand, this will give you a great place to start.

---flag---
Start by identifying your every piece of your restaurant‚Äôs personality, which includes the atmosphere, dec√≥r, type of food, region of cuisine and price point. Then, consider how design elements can elevate that. 
---flag---
For example, bold graphics may fit well for modern eateries, but they might not work for the atmosphere of a laid back cafe or a location that‚Äôs more traditional. Make sure you carry this personality consistently through all of your design.
---flag---
Your logo should help bring new customers in and draw familiar faces back, and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to define who your target audience is and what visuals they expect and enjoy. Who is sitting down at your table or waiting at the bar for their drink? Speak directly to them and what they need.
---flag---
Finally, don‚Äôt forget to imagine how your logo will look on the sparkling, massive sign that welcomes your customers. The best restaurant logos look great there and everywhere you would want to show them off.
---flag---
Elegant touches and extravagant visuals can masterfully tie in the ambiance of a memorable fine dining experience. Upscale logos need to match the decadence of your restaurant.¬†
---flag---
Hand-drawn elements communicate precision and intentionality, while nostalgic fonts inspire a more sentimental and romantic ambiance. Whether your style leans more minimal or you‚Äôre drawn to elaborate details, your upscale, first-class vision can be communicated in countless ways.
---flag---
Casual dining establishments create strong communities, as customers are welcome to return for any occasion. This target customer base should deeply influence the fonts, graphics and colors found in your logo.
---flag---
Create a sense of familiarity and storied history through your logo design. Simple fonts and vintage graphics elicit a sense of tradition, just like the tried-and-true dishes you serve in your restaurant.
---flag---
The food may be quick, but your branding is just as important in a fast food restaurant. Even if your customers spend less time in your establishment than most others, you still need to capture the feeling of satisfaction through deeply intentional graphics that convey exactly what your customer will walk away with.
---flag---
Customers linger at pubs and bars, so communicating the atmosphere of your restaurant with your logo design is essential. Will they be sitting under industrial-chic facades? Let cold and utilitarian aesthetics guide the way. Is your bar focused on serving small batch, natural wine in a quieter space? Look for softer fonts and use white space to create a cleaner look with this type of logo. Focus on design aesthetics that capture just the right mood.
---flag---
It‚Äôs always a good idea to look to the best for inspiration. Here are some of the most iconic and famous restaurant logos to provide you with ideas for your own restaurant venture. These are the logos of the best restaurants in the world that have stood the test of time and their success speaks volumes.
---flag---
If you‚Äôre just starting to develop a logo for your restaurant, the creative process can be intimidating. But here‚Äôs a little crash course.
---flag---
Logo design is a nuanced specialization of graphic design that encompasses aesthetics, branding & marketing, composition, color theory, typography and artistic skill. Get a full introduction to the craft in our article on how to design a logo.
---flag---
Before you can create a logo, your restaurant needs a name. You can play it safe and name it after yourself or use a name that refers to the cuisine you‚Äôre serving, but you can also get creative. Anything is possible.
---flag---
But consider that restaurant names and logos need to go hand in hand. As you scroll through the examples above, notice how the names and logos complement and enhance each other. How they set a mood together. You could also choose a logo that either illustrates your restaurant‚Äôs name or gives your name a second or deeper meaning. Check out this article to learn more about choosing a name for your business.
---flag---
There isn‚Äôt one ‚Äúbest‚Äù type of logo. The most successful ones are those that best represent their brand. The high-energy red and bold, script typography of the Coca Cola logo both suit the brand well, but those same design choices might not work for more relaxed brands like a yoga studio or massage parlor.¬†
---flag---
So before anything else, consider your brand identity. Are you running an upscale restaurant or a humble family-friendly diner? Is your focus in traditional cuisine or a unique fusion of culinary wonders? Your identity will guide your design choices.
---flag---
In design, every color and shape represents different emotions. For example, logos that are primarily black seem more sophisticated, and logos built with circles seem friendlier. That extends to typography, too. Serifs are usually formal, sans-serifs are casual. Every design decision reflects on your brand, so choose wisely.

---flag---
Your restaurant has several different options for getting a logo:
---flag---
DIY and logo makers are only advisable when you‚Äôre working with a very limited budget. Your logo is a branding asset too important to skimp on, and considering how complicated logo design is, if it‚Äôs not designed by a professional, it may not be as effective as it could be.¬†
---flag---
Design contests leverage the creativity of multiple designers, who come up with different ideas of logos designs you can choose from. If you‚Äôre still unsure what style and look is right for you, a logo design contest presents you with all your different options.
---flag---
If you already know what look you‚Äôre going for, your best bet is to work directly with a freelancer. Browse portfolios to find the perfect match and then collaborate with your designer to get a design you‚Äôll love.
---flag---
If your biggest concern is price, check out our logo design cost guide for more detailed information.
---flag---
Just like cooking up delicious experiences for your restaurant is an art form, great branding is an art form too. Get creative with your restaurant logo design so you can give your customers just a taste of what they can expect from you. We hope you‚Äôre inspired and ready to explore the endless option for your own amazing logo!

I went to McDonald's on Causeway in Brandon. The drive through was atrocious. The girl couldn't get my order right then disappeared for 5 minutes. I asked if she was still there and she said yes. I get my order, no sauce for nuggets, the girl that brought it out was upset she had to go get it. I get home, open a burger, and it only had one side of the roll. They can't even put a hamburger in together!
---flag---

---flag---

---flag---
Employees left me out in the snow and wouldn‚Äôt answer the drive through. They locked the doors and it was freezing. I asked the employee a simple question and they were so stupid they answered a completely different question. Dumb employees and bad food.
---flag---

---flag---

---flag---
I‚Äôve never gotten one of my orders right and if it wasn‚Äôt missing hamburgers, fries, it was raw meat and when you go in they act like it's your fault lol. The employees are too good to be there on top of pay. That's nothing when you run around for 6 to 8 hrs like a chicken with its head cut off. Never again will I eat McDonald‚Äôs. Thanks for clogging up my organs and Arteries making my blood so thick throughout the years that you pass it off like ketchup packs in twos.

I used to want to go out to restaurants, or just eat out in general. But Now I‚Äôve seen which ones are a good choice, and which ones are bad. I will be doing a review about Mcdonalds. Mcdonalds is a play a lot of people eat. They have one almost everywhere you go. But you have to realize how bad it is for you. ‚ÄúThe beef patties are formed from ground beef in a factory, then flash frozen and sent to McDonald's restaurants. Before they are served, the patties are seasoned with salt and pepper, then grilled for 40 seconds.‚Äù According to a video from McDonald's Australia. Then the fries are overly packed with things you don't even need on a french fry.
---flag---

---flag---
Their chicken nuggets taste good but do you know what's in them? None of their stuff is fresh, it all comes in bags. Also when you look at the commercials you see a delicious looking burger and then you get the same thing you saw on tv and it's as flat as a pancake?! When I went there and played on the playground the playground was not very clean. It was like the workers did not even clean it. It was very scummy and gross. As a little kid I enjoyed it but looking back it's at the bottom of my list of places to eat.
---flag---

---flag---
No, Prices on menu in drive through. Lady that takes your order cannot speak English very well and cannot get order right and does not understand what you say and charges for a large when I order medium. I cannot understand why McDonalds would let this happen. Until this issue is rectified I will never eat at McDonalds again.

I ordered a Oreo mocha and paid for it. After that I had to wait for 30 to 40 mins before they told me that the Oreo mocha had finished. They gave me a refund and I ordered a hot fudge sundae. I am not satisfied with the service as I had to wait a long time and I did not get what I paid for. I would not recommend anybody to go there.

It's a very very very bad decision and experience to order from your store! Your manager who has a day off blocked me on Whatsapp instead of handling the issue and at least putting me in contact with someone who is on shift! They delivered my order with a missing item which I paid for and they told me they will deliver it back and this was around 9 pm, after 2/2 hours and a half I contacted the manager again who was texting me on whatsapp which is so unprofessional and who was off duty and asked me for the bill because they couldn't find it on the system which also is so UNPROFESSIONAL. Put a reason after 3 hours that they don't have gas and with only 2 drivers so when they have time and a order nearby they will deliver also which is very very very ignorant disrespectful and unprofessional to the maximum...
---flag---

---flag---
The girl who was talking to me as manager from home name's is "THIA", her number is ** and this is the Driver Number **, the order was made to my shop, all was recorded on camera and I have all the text and messages saved on whatsapp and the bill is still with me! Please note that I didn't want the missing item but they insisted on me to pay and they will deliver!

I went to McDonald's drive thru and ordered 15.00 worth of breakfast food, which included pancakes. I did not receive any syrup. I checked after I pulled away since I already checked and saw my food was correct. I do like to be mindful of the time at the window. So I come back around thru drive thru to spend unnecessary time to get syrup that should have already been in my bag. So then I ask for a syrup she hands me one. Now this is where the problem arise. Number one I always get two so I'm assuming y'all hand out two. Three pancakes one syrup. "No mam I'm from the south. I need more syrup than that." Ok let me get back on track. So then she says, "Oh well it's 33 cents," insert air quotes. So I hand her a dollar and say, "Sure just give me two." Then she was like ok. So then I wait 5 mins for my syrup and I'm like, "I'm running y'all time up."

Now we in Baton Rouge, la you know we just had a hurricane Ida and I was without power 4 long hot days. I lost all my food in the fridge and deep freezer. I lost my steaks and shrimp. So I'm like. "Mam you hounding me over 33 cents and a syrup. This the first hot breakfast my family done had in 4 days." I haven't had Chance to replace my food yet. If I had eggs I'd make my own good cheesy eggs. But we not here for that. So back to it boom she walks up to the window and hands me ONE SYRUP!! "MAM I told you two and I was paying for it." Like give me a break. What happened to the community helping the community. I know y'all have a job and have to abide by the policies. But now you know they don't charge everybody 33 cents for no syrup. Now you gave me 87 strawberry jellies that I didn't ask for but couldn't give me the one thing I really needed which was SYRUP!!

I ordered food through the app, some of which they were out of. The manager rudely told me I should contact my bank for a refund. After much back and forth, and no refund, I opened up a case with the BBB. They dragged the case out for 4 months, only replying back to the complaint every 30-45 days. The manager eventually lied and told corporate and the BBB that I had been contacted and refunded. This is not true. I am disgusted, and there is no recourse for me now. App users, beware.

Never order McDonald's from Uber or Skip or any delivery service for that matter, most particularly one on Elgin Street and Rideau Street, they never get the order right. Workers at either of these locations don't know how to follow simple instructions. Don't waste your money at these two locations.

My family and I tried McDonald's breakfast muffins, rolls, and buns yesterday. They were disgusting, they all had an artificial aftertaste. My daughter and son threw theirs away after one bite. I had the apple fritter, and I had to throw it away after two bites. However, we did like their other breakfast items, eggs, sausage, etc.

McDonald's needs to stick with what they do best, hamburgers.

This early morning, July 25, 2021, at 5:00 AM I came to Store No. 18735 located at 14401 S. Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33176 and I witnessed a big change in Customer Service. I just to come here almost every day, this early in the morning and I just to have a very bitter experience almost daily, when the store personnel treated me like an intruder. I like the WiFi of your store, but in the past they even sealed literally the electric outlets to prevent people like me to keep my laptop to be recharged. But today, they opened the store on time and with a positive attitude. 
---flag---

---flag---
The electric outlets were open and the sales personnel were kind and attentive, especially the Shift Manager Ms. ** and the server **, who by the way came to the store in a Mercedes Benz at 5:00 AM sharp. No wonder! Ms. ** told me that they are having problems on recruiting new employees. Perhaps Biden is right, it's supply and demand. By the way, my Seniors coffee was surprisingly fresh and my apple pie was also fresh and warm. I asked Ms. ** if the owners were the same, and she confirmed that. Amazing!

I really think that if you can buy breakfast anytime then I should be able to get a cheeseburger anytime especially since I really don't care for breakfast food. I really like McDonald's food but I preferred tree lunch rather than breakfast. Thank you thank you thank you.

Stopped by a McDonald‚Äôs restaurant recently and got a Sprite to drink with meal. Took 1 drink after getting back on interstate and noticed it tasted bad-real bad. I thought maybe it was where I hadn‚Äôt got a drink like that for a long time and that the taste was fine that it would be better in a few drinks more. But even after 10 min or more the taste it left in my mouth worsened, got really sick, dizzy. And my throat was burning.

Contacted corporate office, explaining the incident in an email. Hadn‚Äôt expected to hear back from anyone, and was shocked when I received a call from MR. Roy **, the general manager in charge of the chain with the areas where I live. He was very apologetic and expressed that he had spoken with the manager and crew at the specific store that I went that day and they were going to contact me as well. He was very professional but in a down-to-earth way. Very efficient in the way all was handled. So, I really appreciate the time and effort that MR. ** put forth in getting in touch with me and the steps taken to resolve the situation. Remember, as it is said that one bad Apple spoils the bunch.. not always true in every instance.

Well I normally never go to McDonald's because it nothing they have I really like. But I been wanting to try their new chicken sandwich. Well it is the worst chicken sandwich I every had. Popeyes beat them by a long shot but the best is Chick-fil-A. My sandwich was mostly breading, over cooked and I had a very thin chicken. I thought I got the McChicken, 1.00 sandwich. It was nasty and where is the chicken. It was more breading than chicken. It was the worst chicken sandwich I every had. I never go back to another McDonald's as long as I live.

Any time I go to McDonald's I don‚Äôt get customer service. I don‚Äôt know why I order their 10 pc Chicken Nuggets because they never provide me with the sauce that they ask me that I want. How annoying to order and not receive the sauce. Why order at all.

We ordered Ultimate burger McShare since it is my daughter‚Äôs bday and she wants to have McChicken Sandwich, when the delivery came there‚Äôs no Mc chicken sandwich and no one answers from the hotline to at-least send what‚Äôs missing, we emailed and send messages to their FB page but we didn‚Äôt get any response. They‚Äôre operating 24/7 so they should have support for incidents like this. We have to literally ‚ÄúMcshare‚Äù our food because of this even though we paid the whole amount! Verrry frustrating.

It was mentioned big when I purchase order from their tool on the store. At the end received small saying big means only French fries and drinks. No mentioned that it is only drinks and fries but agent showed me pic saying you can notice only drinks and fries item. This is very bad experience as customer service to pay extra 8 dirhams to get big fries and drinks. Ridiculous with their customer service, worst company, people and this company is there just to make money.

I was at the McDonald's in San Diego off Texas Street with errors in my order and there was a rude manager Alberto who was disrespectful, rude and does not know how to treat customers. He argued with me and literally laughed at me when I voiced my concern. You need to educate your managers on how to be respectful of their customers!

McDonalds! Who doesn't love them, but it's unfortunate to say that Phoenix Jumbo's staffs lacks some customers services and lack of attention towards their customers. Just because we all love mcdonalds does mean you shouldn't have a good way to treat the clients. I had a issue two times with them. I had my order on the online systems found in the store. As I was the only customer in the store they served me enough quick which I was happy but while checking my bag, they forgot to give me my chips as I had ordered a meal combo. I had to return and ask for it. Like where are you guys attention? If it was a busy day I would have understand. 
---flag---

---flag---
The second time, I was around the second customers. My command was literally ready in around 3mins. But instead of shouting for my command like they used to or acknowledge I was standing right in front of them, they just place the packet in front of the command service and went busy. I didn't even know my command was ready until I asked for my number. Like what is this? Is this how you gonna treat customers now? Most of my friends has this issue as well. So my advise, is better to train your staff again well so as in the nearest future, you don't lose customer. I would surely highlight that KFC's customer service is definitely better than mcdo.
---flag---

They couldn't even say please and thank you when it wasn't busy. The store is 2901 Wilmington Pike Kettering Ohio 46429. Rude as hell. Can't say please or thank you during the order. Said these people don't need their job there. They blow.

We ordered 2 of the new crispy deluxe chicken sandwiches. Both were overcooked. Very dry tasting and the buns were slightly burnt. We called to complain and were offered a replacement. The next day, we ordered two more of the same sandwiches. Although slightly better, both were still slightly overcooked and dry tasting. The sandwiches were hastily thrown together with the tomato, lettuce and sauce all poorly distributed and falling off. Not really what we should expect for a sandwich costing nearly five dollars. I truly believe the 99 cent crispy chicken sandwich is better than any of the deluxe sandwiches we received. I know it's McDonalds, but come on.

McDonalds food was always so good but ever since they add new/more crispy chicken sandwiches it has come out bad. At first I thought oh they must haven't had a good day but every time I go there now it's always soggy, and has no flavor. They need to fix this!!!

I had to go on April 2/2021 to 6049 Roswell Road, to get a hashbrown they forgot to give in the last visit. They said I had to go back another day; I said I was going to put a claim, the lady said I don't care and just closed the drive thru window. I asked to speak to a manager and told her I wouldn't leave the drive thru until I spoke to a manager; the manager arrived and told me that she would have the cops escort me off the premises. They didn't want to give me any name or anything. The worst experience in my life.

I went to the S (1941 E Montgomery Cross Road, Savannah, GA 31406 (912) 401-0734) on Sunday Nov 29th 2020 and bought a Big Mac (3:10pm). I brought it home and began to eat it that afternoon, on my 3rd bite I bit down on a large shard of glass that was contained in the big mac. It bruised my tongue and I caught it right before I almost swallowed it. I went to Candler Hospital for a check of my chest and stomach on Sunday Nov 29th. I contacted Mc Donalds HQ via their email form on Nov 29th. I received a reply From Mc Donalds HQ on Mon Nov 30th. They explained that they are a franchised company and that my concerns would be directed to the franchise where I bought the hamburger.

At this time the manager ** and her representatives, Palm Management (Palmaccio Management Corp, John Palmaccio) and the Mc Donalds corporation take zero responsibility for this event and have dismissed all claims related to this horrific, emotionally traumatizing experience.

As of 02/25/2021 Mc Donalds takes Zero responsibility for what they did. I am **.

I just ordered the new crispy chicken sandwich and I'm very disappointed. Not only did it taste horrible, but it was more bun than chicken. Not at all like the commercial shows. I hate sweet pickles and there were two slices on my sandwich. I wish I could add a photo to show the huge bun and tiny chicken.

Stopped at Calabasas CA MacDonald's Sunday 3-7-21 and ordered 2 regular Cheese burgers, 1 quarter pounder w/ cheese and bacon and 1 large fries. Paid requested $22.29 at drive through. After reaching our destination we looked at the order and found 2 1/4 pounders w/cheese, 1 w/ cheese and bacon and a large fries. There was no receipt in the bag to explain the price we were charged. Checking prices for everything online was impossible on their website but found a 1/4 pounder w/ cheese was $3.79, large fries $1.89. 2 cheeseburgers were for $2.00. No way this order could be $22.29 the way it was ordered or the way we received it. Called 3 times to the Calabasas shop and got no answer. Tried again on Wednesday and got an answer. I explained the situation to a seemingly uninterested fellow who said I could try back Friday and ask for Abbes. I guess we will see what happens.

I'm emailing to make a complaint about my meals. I called up the store in question to make a complaint. I spoke to a manager called Alex who didn't help me about my issue in question. I suffer really bad with my mental health. I didn't want it to go this far but he left me no choice. I've got the receipts. I gave him my order details. I told him what happened regarding my meals. He wanted me to go back in bins to get food back out which I don't think is acceptable regardless what's going on with this virus. So many hands have touch the bins. My anxiety was getting worse while he was asking me this. I'm disgusted really that this is the way you treat your vulnerable customers. I don't feel like ever eating Mcdonald's anymore. You've lost a very loyal customer including my family.

I have just had the worst customer service experience in my entire life. My wife and I were ordering 2 separate orders, I was cut off twice during my 1st order, and as I started my second order the person on the speaker told me that I cannot put 2 coupon items on the same order, I told her that she misheard me, that I was done with the 1st order, and starting the 2nd, and she told me that I was still adding to my 1st order. I again told her that she misheard me that I wanted to start my 2nd order and she said "you can leave". I said "excuse me". She said "leave".

I asked to speak to a manager and told her I wouldn't leave the drive thru until I spoke to a manager and she told me that she was the manager and that she would have the cops escort me off the premises. I proceeded to call the store and ask for a manager and the same woman at the speaker answered the phone and told me she was the manager. I asked for her name and she told me Madison, and I asked for her full name to report her to corporate and she repeated herself "Madison, that is all you need." I have NEVER been treated so poorly by ANY establishment EVER in my ENTIRE LIFE!!! We as a couple feel discriminated against!

I seem to experience egg shells in breakfast sandwiches far too often. It seems to be more at some locations than others. Think it may be the aspiring chef in the cooks trying to do the one handed egg breaks. No matter the reason, egg shells totally ruin a good egg sandwich. Wish McDonald‚Äôs would address this issue.

I went tonight 12/08/2020. Bought 4 McRibs and boy were they the worst. They must changed it for those people that say eat healthy. Took all the flavor out of it, poured tons of bbq sauce on it and the pickle dont taste right on it. To me taste like cucumber not a pickle. Me and my husband will never buy those overpriced sandwiches again. Lost 2 McRib customers!!!

On Dec 3rd 2020, I went to McDonalds around 7 o'clock pm, I ordered 3 Mc Chickens with no lettuce and a large fry and 2 drinks, ok I got my order going back to work, so I turned back and explain that I only have 2 sandwiches both with lettuce, so I was giving the young lady back the bag, she said she couldn't take back, the manager (Treno) something like that, was yelling, "What's the problem," so I explained, he took the bag and went to the back, and I was asked to pull up, after that I pulled up. Another young man handed me a bag and I ate a few fries, then the same manager said, "Oh sorry. That's not your bag," after I said, " dang my order is messed up again," he then ask me for the bag, and close the window and took that same bag that I ate out of to the other car that was waiting, BEWARE. Stay safe, COVID IS OUT HERE... SO PLEASE BE SAFE, THAT GUY SHOULD OF BEEN FIRED ON THE SPOT...VERY BAD...THE WORST I EVER SEEN.

Walmart doesn't have them, Lowe's doesn't have them, Home Depot doesn't have them, Harbor Freight Tools doesn't have them. My local McDonalds has no idea where to get one. The manager had no idea. I called Customer Service. This is what the complaint is for...
---flag---

---flag---
The representative told me they are made by an outside company. I asked if there was anywhere to find the screwdriver to remove the screws. He got RUDE, telling me "I already told you, they are made by an outside company!" Then HE HUNG UP ON ME! This is what passes as Customer SERVICE? Never in my life have I been treated so shabbily by somebody whose JOB it is to handle customer complaints and inquiries. I'll never eat at a McDonalds again. There are too many burger places out there to put up with THIS kind of rudeness from somebody whose JOB it is to answer customers' questions!

On Nov 17, I was waiting for my order and noticed the guy cooking was wearing a plastic mask, but his face mask was below his chin. While they were packing my order he wiped his nose with his wrist and this is when I when I noticed he wasn't even wearing gloves. I was so disgusted that I decided to leave and threw my order in the garbage on the way out. I've contacted the head office 3 times and keep being told that this is unacceptable and I even have an email saying that they are very disappointed with what happened and someone would contact me. I just called again and keep being told the same thing..STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION!!!!

I‚Äôm not sure where any of these good reviews are coming from? I am writing after years of visiting the McDonald‚Äôs on Owen Rd. In Fenton, MI. I have never had a good experience here. I guess I was tired of terrible food and service so I‚Äôm reviewing it now. The wait is usually so long most people and many times myself simply leave. If you can wait you have a less than 50% chance your order and beverage will be correct.

The issue most times and today was we didn‚Äôt have a wait and we seemed a bit in shock but once we got home we understood why. The food was cold, stale and basically inedible! I throw out food here more times than I eat it. We go at times because of their hours here where I live. We joke on if we will get fresh food or not. We have learned to at least check our beverage before we leave the window. We know this may upset customers who have waited but most of the time they can‚Äôt even get our beverage order correct. They are young and lazy and if they aren‚Äôt joking or being rude they don‚Äôt care if your food is disgusting. I understand we should stay away from greasy fast food anyway but the biggest issue is McDonald‚Äôs greed! They keep increasing the prices of food but the quality continues to get worse.

J Balvin if I were you I would be ashamed to advertise this as my special deal. Big mac bun was dry, and fell apart in my hands. Burger did not taste at all good, like back in the day when a big mac was a big mac!

McDonalds told me that they're only willing to serve licensed motorized vehicles at the drive thru when I tried riding my bike thru there, they refused to serve me, but the very next day, I witnessed them serving a moped at the drive thru. The moped is an UNLICENSED motorized vehicle. I contacted the corporate office about the problem but they have ignored it.

I pull through the drive-thru and the customer service is excellent. I order 2 hot and spicy McChicken sandwiches for a cool $2, a McGriddle for a little bit more that comes with a hashbrown and a perfect textured orange juice. The hot and spicy mcchickens are beautiful for the $1 spent on them each. So good. The mcgiddle is amazing quality. The pancake buns are delicious with the rich flavor of maple syrup and the instant warmth of the sandwich. The food is always hot and fresh. Now the hashbrown. The hashbrown smacks. SOOO GOOOD. Perfect golden crispiness on the outside, not too mushy on the inner side, absolutely perfect. Nothing like it in the world. It just smacks.

I have been visited every weekend. And it's a nice place to eats without any disturbance. And make me relax. I love a spicy chicken and kebab wrap lover. Whenever I visit McDonalds I placed this order. And I love that McDonalds black forest as desserts.

I've eaten McDonalds 4 days a week for 45 years. I will never again eat there because they run an advertisement every 6 minutes on USA Television and I hate the ad. They advertise way too much on one station and I will never eat there again. There is a lot more people like me will never go there again. They stepped on their own sick you could say.

I'm not happy that they took that steak egg and cheese bagels off the menu when it the best thing in the morning. Not going there for breakfast and when the staff at really rude and not respectful to the customers.

The quarter pounder should be renamed the nickel pounder as the the meat has been reduced the size of quarter. Come on company see the light and see people will stop buying this rip off and go to Burger King and order a whopper.

Golden British Columbia. We were traveling and stopped for food at the McDonalds. The line up outside was very long and my husband wanted to go elsewhere but I wanted a McDonalds coffee as in my lifetime they have never let me down. Well there‚Äôs a first for everything. We got 3 coffees because we knew how good they are and had a long drive. The coffee was so weak we could not even drink them. I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but it was so bad that I really feel I need to. I would have thought that to get a McDonalds franchise you would have to keep the products sold in line with the company standard.

I am so disappointed I am done with McDonalds. The fillet o fish my husband had was so dry he could not eat it. There were 3 people that came back to the door because their order was missing sandwiches. There was one lady came back because she was missing her sugar that she specifically asked for. That‚Äôs 4 orders wrong in just the time we were there. This isn‚Äôt the first McDonalds we found with less than okay service in the past month. The Prince Rupert McDonalds has gone completely downhill as well. Very disappointed to say the least.

We drove up to the drive-up and we ordered 2 Mcchicken sandwiches, 2 filet-O-fish, 2 med fries and 1 med lemonade. There was two of us, we drove around to park and eat in our car. We opened the fish sandwiches and we were so disappointed. They were so small and we were charged over $4 each for these pathetic looking sandwiches. The mcchicken sandwich was bigger and half the cost!! It seems like a big company wouldn‚Äôt want to look so bad! We come from a large family and a lot of us grew up on McDonalds food! It‚Äôs not the cost. It‚Äôs the quality that‚Äôs important to us! I felt a strong desire to share this with you. Sincerely yours, Gloria

I haven't eaten at McDonalds for years. I saw a commercial and remembered how good the fries were. More, they must be thinking they're selling gold nuggets, as there are no real values or specials. The fries were cold and stale. I ate around 5 and threw the rest out. I was stunned, as I believed their QC was above average. For them to put that garbage in a bag, I can assure them I will never spend another penny there. Simply, they have earned my review with the hope others will beware similarly. The global monster deserve a re-set. They can't even get the fries right. I'm both angered and sad.

I was given a Burnt breakfast sandwich! I know it only cost a $1, but you still should receive a decent sandwich that is edible. How can anyone feel this is okay to give a customer? I wish I can download a picture.

Yesterday we purchased a cone via the drive through at McDonalds, Brunswick, MD. When delivered, the cone was dripping. The server had no gloves on. Additionally, he had a mask, but it was around his neck, not where it belonged, covering his mouth and nose! We threw the cone away never to return.

I have been going every day for many, many years to get my treat for the day, a nonfat mocha. It was a daily ritual and I felt like I could indulge while still saving calories. Recently they have eliminated the nonfat option and only offer whole milk now, very disappointing to say the least. They have lost a loyal customer and I will not be going back. There are many other establishments that provide consumers with other alternatives.

I was completely applaud that I went to order a salad and was told salads were removed from the menu??? Really how can such a huge franchise remove the one healthy thing on the Menu? What happened to Healthy eating? Not everyone goes to McDonalds and eats this food I specially went to treat my daughter and I am a salad and veggie person so the fact that I could not get a salad left me with my mouth opened. YOU NEED TO ADAPT A HEALTHY MENU! I'm real disappointed!!

I purchase a large vanilla sugar and fat free vanilla latte daily but have not been able to for some time because the San Diego stores are out of non fat milk. Please when will you have non fat milk on stock again.

MCDONALDS ON 3826 SW 40th Blvd. The coworkers are very disrespectful 99.89% of the times I go there. IF I plan to go there I order on the mobile app to avoid as much attitude and bad energy I can get through a drive through but that doesn‚Äôt even work. The staff was beyond rude. I usually avoid this location because of the disrespectful employees, bad food quality, slow lines, and because they always find a new way to mess up my order. I asked them for items that were ordered through the app and on my receipt like SAUCES, and they REFUSED to give them to me then shut the window and walked away. Haven‚Äôt seen anything like it. I wouldn‚Äôt go. They ruin your mood. The disrespect is beyond me. I want my money back. If I could give them no stars, oh I definitely would.

I love Mcdonalds. I just have a problem with owners of the Anthem Az and Tramonto Az locations. While all other fastfood reopened the dining rooms in May 2020. These two locations refuse to reopen to diners. The employees don't even know when the owner will let people dine in. This is Arizona where lunch time temperatures are over 100 degrees. Not a good option to sit in your car or outside. It appears the owner of these two locations is choosing not to spend money to keep the dinning area clean. Just keep diners out. I think it's awful to treat customers like that. I wish McDonalds Corp. would force this franchiser to reopen just like In&out, Burger King, Jack in the Box and all others have done.

The app is very poorly put together for the consumer. How do you let it put through an order and have the customer go to the restaurant to pick it up and be told  they don't have it because the restaurant computer is offline. I have had 4 back surgeries and I'm disabled so for me to walk there stand in line with the other cars in the drive thru and not get my food is BS. And they don't give a courtesy Drink, Fry, or Pie at the McD on Hwy W 50 in Pueblo Co. I Could have got CORONA VIRUS for nothing.

I was eating lunch at McDonalds in Walmart Nacogdoches, the server wasn't wearing gloves and had long FAKE fingernails, clear violation of the health code, her fake nail ended up in my burger, and damaged my tooth, McDonalds' sorry ** have yet to do a damn thing about it. I'm hiring a lawyer as I speak. Never eat and that nasty place again.

I only do fast foods occasionally and usually it varies from place to place. I wanted a meal on the way home from shopping and hadn't had chicken McNuggets in probably 2 or 3 years so why not. Ordered a combo meal with med fries and a large drink. Got home, put away my shopping and opened up to a literal cold meal. It was so cold the fries were starting to coagulate and the chicken was probably room temperature. I heated everything up and ate but this will probably be the last time I go there.

Went to drive thru at McDonalds. Asked to have a side salad. Was told they no longer have them. Was quite surprised by this. So many places make it hard for a person to try & eat healthy these days. Guess fattening fast food is so much better...NOT!
